# Social Sharing Plan for Scripture Memory App

## Overview
Add social sharing functionality to encourage users to share their achievements and promote the app. This will focus on streak accomplishments and be designed to not interrupt the user's flow.

## Core Requirements

### Streak Achievement Tracking
- **Trigger**: When user reaches a new longest word guess streak record
- **Minimum Threshold**: Only track streaks over 50 words
- **Storage**: Save achievement data in localStorage for later prompting
- **Timing**: Don't interrupt during streak - wait until streak resets to 0

### Social Sharing Features
- **Platforms**: Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Email
- **Content**: Pre-written messages with customizable elements
- **Sharing**: Direct links to social platforms with pre-filled content
- **Analytics**: Track sharing events for engagement metrics

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Achievement Tracking System

#### localStorage Structure
```javascript
// Achievement data structure
{
  "social_share_pending": {
    "streak": 183,
    "achieved_at": 1705123456789,
    "shared": false,
    "share_count": 0
  }
}
```

#### Achievement Detection
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/VerseList.tsx` - where streak updates happen
- **Trigger**: When `newStreak > longestStreak` and `newStreak > 50`
- **Action**: Save achievement data to localStorage

#### Achievement Prompting
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/VerseList.tsx` - when streak resets to 0
- **Condition**: Check if `social_share_pending` exists and `shared: false`
- **Action**: Show social sharing modal

### 2. Social Sharing Modal Component

#### Component Structure
```typescript
interface SocialShareModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  achievement: {
    streak: number;
    achieved_at: number;
  };
}
```

#### Features
- **Pre-written messages** for each platform
- **Customizable text** with user's streak number
- **Direct sharing links** with pre-filled content
- **Copy to clipboard** functionality
- **Analytics tracking** for share events

### 3. Message Templates

### 5. File Structure

```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SocialShareModal.tsx          # Main sharing modal
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SocialShareButton.tsx         # Individual share buttons
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ socialSharing.ts              # Sharing utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ achievements.ts               # Achievement tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ social.d.ts                   # Type definitions
â””â”€â”€ constants/
    â””â”€â”€ socialMessages.ts             # Message templates
```

### 6. Social Sharing Utilities

#### Platform URLs
```typescript
const SHARE_URLS = {
  twitter: 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet',
  facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php',
  linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite',
  whatsapp: 'https://wa.me',
  email: 'mailto:'
};
```

#### URL Generation
```typescript
function generateShareUrl(platform: string, message: string, url: string): string {
  const encodedMessage = encodeURIComponent(message);
  const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(url);
  
  switch (platform) {
    case 'twitter':
      return `${SHARE_URLS.twitter}?text=${encodedMessage}`;
    case 'facebook':
      return `${SHARE_URLS.facebook}?u=${encodedUrl}&quote=${encodedMessage}`;
    case 'linkedin':
      return `${SHARE_URLS.linkedin}?url=${encodedUrl}&title=${encodedMessage}`;
    case 'whatsapp':
      return `${SHARE_URLS.whatsapp}?text=${encodedMessage}`;
    case 'email':
      return `${SHARE_URLS.email}?subject=Scripture Memory Achievement&body=${encodedMessage}`;
    default:
      return '';
  }
}
```

### 7. User Experience Flow

#### Achievement Flow
1. **User achieves streak > 50** â†’ Achievement saved silently
2. **User continues playing** â†’ No interruption
3. **Streak resets to 0** â†’ Check for pending achievements
4. **Show sharing modal** â†’ Encourage social sharing
5. **User shares or dismisses** â†’ Mark as handled

#### Modal Behavior
- **Non-blocking**: User can dismiss without sharing
- **One-time**: Each achievement only prompts once
- **Respectful**: Doesn't interrupt active gameplay
- **Optional**: Sharing is completely voluntary

### 8. Analytics & Tracking

#### Events to Track
```typescript
// Achievement events
'achievement_unlocked' // When streak > 50 is reached
'achievement_prompted' // When sharing modal is shown
'achievement_shared'   // When user shares on social
'achievement_dismissed' // When user dismisses modal

// Platform-specific events
'share_twitter'
'share_facebook'
'share_linkedin'
'share_whatsapp'
'share_email'
'share_copy_link'
```

#### Data to Collect
- Achievement streak length
- Time between achievement and sharing
- Platform preferences
- Share success rates
- User engagement patterns

### 9. Accessibility Considerations

#### Features
- **Keyboard navigation** for modal
- **Screen reader support** for sharing options
- **High contrast** mode support
- **Focus management** when modal opens/closes
- **Alternative text** for social platform icons

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Accessibility attributes
aria-label="Share your achievement on social media"
aria-describedby="achievement-description"
role="dialog"
tabIndex={-1}
```
