# Group Management Feature Planning

## High-Level Overview

The group management feature will allow leaders (teachers, pastors, small group leaders, etc.) to create and manage groups of users, customize their learning experience, and monitor their progress. This feature will enhance the social and accountability aspects of scripture memory while providing valuable tools for leaders.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Groups
- Groups are collections of users managed by one or more leaders
- Each group can have its own:
  - Custom verse sets
  - Progress tracking
  - Leaderboards
  - Communication channels
  - Settings and preferences

### 2. Roles
- **Group Leaders**: Can manage group settings, add/remove members, assign verses, and view group analytics
- **Group Members**: Regular users who are part of the group, with access to group-specific features
- **Group Admins**: (Optional) Super-leaders who can manage multiple groups and group leaders

### 3. Key Features

#### For Group Leaders
- Create and manage groups
- Invite members via email or shareable links
- Assign custom verse sets to the entire group
- Monitor group progress and engagement
- View group-specific leaderboards
- Send announcements or reminders
- Set group goals and milestones
- Export group progress reports

#### For Group Members
- Join groups via invitation
- Access group-specific verse sets
- View group leaderboards
- Receive group announcements
- Track progress relative to group goals

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Database schema updates for groups and relationships
2. Basic group creation and management
3. Member invitation system
4. Group-specific verse assignment

### Phase 2: Group Features
1. Group leaderboards
2. Progress tracking and analytics
3. Basic communication tools
4. Group settings and preferences

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Advanced analytics and reporting
2. Group goals and milestones
3. Enhanced communication tools
4. Group-specific achievements

## Technical Considerations

### Database Changes Needed
- New tables:
  - `groups`
  - `group_members`
  - `group_verses`
  - `group_leaderboards`
  - `group_announcements`

### API Endpoints
- Group management endpoints
- Member management endpoints
- Verse assignment endpoints
- Analytics and reporting endpoints

### UI/UX Considerations
- Group dashboard for leaders
- Member management interface
- Group-specific progress views
- Mobile-friendly group features

## Security and Privacy
- Role-based access control
- Data isolation between groups
- Privacy settings for group members
- Secure invitation system

## Future Considerations
- Multiple group membership
- Cross-group features
- Group templates
- Integration with external tools
- Automated reporting and notifications

## Questions to Consider
1. How should we handle users who are part of multiple groups?
2. What level of customization should group leaders have?
3. How can we ensure group features don't overwhelm the core scripture memory experience?
4. What metrics are most valuable for group leaders to track?
5. How can we make group management intuitive for non-technical leaders?

## Next Steps
1. Gather feedback on this plan
2. Prioritize features for initial implementation
3. Design detailed database schema
4. Create wireframes for key interfaces
5. Develop implementation timeline
