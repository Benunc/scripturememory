# Version 1.4.1 - Authentication and Debug Improvements

This patch release focuses on fixing authentication issues and improving the development experience with better debug logging.

## Bug Fixes

### Authentication System
- **Fixed redirect loop** when accessing protected routes like `/points` while authenticated
- **Improved token validation** by checking with the backend instead of just localStorage
- **Enhanced loading states** to prevent premature redirects during authentication checks
- **Fixed conditional sign-in modal** to only show when user is not authenticated

### React Hooks
- **Fixed React hooks warning** in PointsStats component by moving `useColorModeValue` calls to component top
- **Improved hook order consistency** to follow React's Rules of Hooks
- **Fixed authentication context usage** in PointsStats component

### Debug Logging
- **Replaced console.log statements** with proper debug logging in content system
- **Added debug import** to content utilities for consistent logging
- **Improved content loading logs** with `[API]` prefix when debug is enabled
- **Enhanced error handling** in content parsing with proper debug messages

## Technical Improvements

### Authentication Flow
- **Enhanced `checkSession` function** to validate tokens with backend
- **Added proper error handling** for invalid/expired tokens
- **Improved state management** for authentication loading states
- **Fixed race conditions** in authentication state updates

### Content System
- **Replaced 15+ console.log statements** with debug.log calls
- **Added proper error logging** for content loading failures
- **Improved content parsing logs** for better debugging
- **Enhanced blog and changelog loading** with consistent logging

### Component Improvements
- **Fixed ProtectedRoute component** to handle loading states properly
- **Improved App component** to respect authentication state for sign-in modal
- **Enhanced PointsStats component** with proper hook usage
- **Fixed color mode value usage** to prevent hook order issues

## User Experience

### Authentication
- **No more redirect loops** when accessing protected pages while logged in
- **Smoother authentication flow** with proper loading states
- **Better error handling** for expired or invalid tokens
- **Improved sign-in modal behavior** that respects current authentication state

### Development Experience
- **Cleaner console output** with proper debug logging
- **Better debugging tools** when debug mode is enabled
- **Consistent logging format** across all API calls
- **Reduced console noise** in production builds

## For Developers

### Debug System
- **Enable debug mode** with `window.debug.enable()` in browser console
- **View API logs** with `[API]` prefix when debug is enabled
- **Content loading logs** show file discovery and parsing progress
- **Error logs** provide detailed information for troubleshooting

### Authentication Debugging
- **Token validation logs** show backend verification status
- **Loading state logs** help identify race conditions
- **Redirect logs** show authentication flow decisions
- **Error logs** provide context for authentication failures

## Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Authentication flow improvements are backward compatible
- Debug logging is opt-in and doesn't affect production builds

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal performance impact** from enhanced token validation
- **Improved caching** in content system with better error handling
- **Reduced console overhead** in production builds

This release improves the reliability of the authentication system and provides better tools for debugging and development.
