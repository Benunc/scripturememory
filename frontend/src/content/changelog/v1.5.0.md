# Version 1.5.0 - Social Sharing and Achievement System

This feature release introduces a comprehensive social sharing system that encourages users to celebrate their scripture memorization achievements while fixing an annoying bug in the streak tracking logic for brand new users.

## New Features

- **Multi-platform sharing** support for Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Email
- **Achievement tracking** with localStorage persistence to remember unshared achievements
- **Smart sharing logic** that adapts based on verse length and user performance

### Achievement Triggers
- **Short verse completions** (≤ 10 words): Always trigger social sharing regardless of streak length
- **Long verse completions** (> 10 words): Trigger social sharing only when streak ≥ 50 words
- **New record achievements**: Trigger social sharing when user beats their longest streak
- **Best streak sharing**: Always share the user's best streak ever, not just the completion streak

### Social Media Integration
- **Twitter/X sharing** with optimized character count and hashtags
- **Facebook sharing** with detailed achievement descriptions
- **LinkedIn sharing** with professional achievement framing
- **WhatsApp sharing** for personal connections
- **Email sharing** for direct communication

- **Achievement dismissal** with proper state management
- **Visual feedback** with platform-specific colors and icons

## Bug Fixes
