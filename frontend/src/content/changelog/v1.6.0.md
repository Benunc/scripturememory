# Verse Streaks - Track Your Progress Per Verse

A major new feature that tracks your guess streaks on individual verses, making it easier to see your progress and stay motivated when learning new verses.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

### **Individual Verse Streak Tracking**
- **Per-verse streaks**: Each verse now tracks its own guess streak separately
- **Visual feedback**: See your best and current streak for each verse on the verse cards
- **Motivation boost**: No more discouragement from long global streaks when starting new verses

### **Enhanced Verse Cards**
- **Streak badges**: Each verse card shows "Best: X words" for verses you've practiced
- **Current streak indicator**: Active verses show "Current: X words" in green
- **Contextual labels**: Clear "Your guess streaks on [Verse Name]:" labels

### **Improved Points Page**
- **Verse streaks section**: New dedicated section showing your top 6 verses by best streak
- **Best streak tracking**: See your best ever streak for each verse

### **Smart State Management**
- **Active verse tracking**: Only the verse you're currently practicing shows current streak
- **Automatic reset**: Current streak resets when switching verses or clicking outside
