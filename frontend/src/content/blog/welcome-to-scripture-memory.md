Hi! I'm Ben Meredith, and I'm excited to introduce you to Scripture Memory.

## Why I Built This

One summer in college, I memorized the entire book of Philippians on breaks during a summer job. This one good decision amidst a sea of questionable decisions during college has born much fruit in my life over the ensuing decades. 

I can't count the number of times God has brought to mind a snippet of that amazing letter just when I needed it.

I had a stack of notecards containing the entire text, hand-written. Using one card, I'd cover parts of the other, and quiz myself, growing in my ability to make it longer and longer through the verses and chapters. Over time, I plodded through the whole book.

Much of it is lost now, and i regretably chose to discontinue that habit after that one summer.

In addition to advent of smart devices that rendered the concept of "spare time" or "boredom" a thing of the past, I've leaned into web technology over those decades, and decided to pick back up my habit, but this time with a digital tool.

Leading my kids and their peers at our church youth group, I decided to try my hand at making this an interactive experience. 

## What Makes This Different

Scripture Memory is designed around the science of spaced repetition and the joy of community. It  combines:
- **Spaced repetition** for effective memorization
- **Gamification** to keep you motivated
- **Community features** for accountability and encouragement
- **Simple, focused interface** that doesn't distract from the Word

## Our Mission

To help believers hide God's Word in their hearts through technology that serves rather than distracts.

Whether you're a youth group leader looking to engage your students, a pastor wanting to encourage your congregation, or an individual believer seeking to grow in scripture memory, we're here to help.

Like Paul says in the first Chapter of Philippians (use the Philippians 1 chapter challenge verse set to memorize it... here it is from my memory today): "It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with wisdom and all discerment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ."
